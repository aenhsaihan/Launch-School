1. a method that returns the sum of two integers

***casual***
ask the user for two numbers
save each number to a separate variable
perform an addition operation on the two numbers, and save the result to a variable
output the result variable to the screen

***formal***
START

SET number1 = GET first number from user
SET number2 = GET second number from user

SET result = number1 + number2

PRINT result

END

2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

***casual***
given an array of strings
set aside a variable as an empty string for the final result
iterate through each string in the array
beginning with the first one, shovel each string into the final result variable
once iteration is finished, output the result variable onto the screen

***formal***
START

# given an array of strings

SET final_string = empty string

SET iterator = 1

WHILE iterator < length of the array of strings
	SET final_string = shovel value within the array at space "iterator"

	iterator = iterator + 1

PRINT final_string

END

3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

***casual***
given an array of integers
set aside an empty array for the result
iterate over each integer in the array
for integers at an odd position, skip to the next iteration
otherwise, add the integer into the empty result array

***formal***
START

# given an array of integers

SET result_array = initialize an empty array

SET iterator = 1

WHILE iterator < length of the array of integers
	IF position of integer in the ithe array is even
		SET result_array = add integer as an element
	ELSE
		skip to the next iteration

PRINT result_array

END
