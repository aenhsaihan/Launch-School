# ! is  a convention used in ruby to indicate that the method may cause undesired side-effects

# != is used to say something is NOT EQUAL to something. It can be used anywhere where you check for inequality
# !user_name would negate the value in user_name. So if user_name were true, it would negate it to false, and vice-versa.
# words.uniq! would mutate the original collection by removig duplicate elements from the collection permanently
# putting ? before something may cause an error if Ruby does not allow you to name variable as such
# putting ? after something doesn't do anything, it is simply a convention
# putting !! before something would do nothing ultimately, since !! would cancel itself out
